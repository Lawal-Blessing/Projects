## INTRODUCTION

The employee survey responses conducted across the departments provided valuable insights into workplace practices, and employee engagement. The dashboard highlights key insights on supervisor’s accountability, job satisfaction, employee recognition perception and survey participation. The question with the most agree responses is “I know what is expected of me at work” while the question with the most disagreed response is “I have a best friend at work”

## TOOLS
EXCEL

## OBSERVATION/RECOMMENDATION
Based on the results in the dashboard several keys areas of concern and strength were identified, as an employer the following steps can be taken to improve employee satisfaction and overall workplace experiences.


 -	Enhance recognition and praises:
The survey indicates that some employees feel underappreciation for their contributions. Departments like the sheriff’s departments have a higher percentage of disagree in the question “In the last seven days I have received recognition or praise for doing good works”. Employers should implement structured recognition programs (e.g. “employee of the month”, shout outs during meetings, or peer to peer recognition Consistently acknowledging good performance can strengthen motivation and create a positive work culture.

- Strengthen Supervisor Accountability:
Results show that certain departments disagree with the statement that supervisors hold employees accountable fairly. Employers should provide training for supervisors on effective performance management, constructive feedback, and equitable accountability. This ensures that employees perceive performance evaluations as fair and consistent across departments.

- Improve Job Satisfaction:
The total percentage of employee that agree to the overall satisfaction with their work are 76.25%. While some employees report satisfaction with their roles, the dashboard highlights 
opportunities for improvement. Employers should encourage career growth through professional development programs, mentorship, and clear promotion pathways, Regular check-ins and feedback sessions can help employees feel heard and supported and as well help employer understands employee needs and provide career growth opportunities.

-	Workplace Friendship and Engagement
Survey results shows that many employees do not have best friend at work. While this may reduce distractions and maintain professional boundaries, research suggests that strong workplace friendships often increase engagement, collaboration and overall job satisfaction. This could be an area for improvement in building a more connected workplace culture. Employer should create cross- departmental interactions, encourage team bonding activities and as well promote inclusivity to ensure no employee feels isolated.

# (RESTAURANT RATING SURVEY)
## INTRODUCTION

The restaurant rating dataset which contains information about restaurants in Mexico. A customer survey was carried out in this city in 2012 to collate information about each restaurant, their cuisines, information about their consumers and the preferences of the consumers. Meaning insight from the data set should be drawn which would aid business entrepreneurs and investors in making more informed decisions. 

## TOOLS
Power Bi, DAX, Data Modeling, Power point

## DATA SOURCE

This dataset was given by Digitaley drive as a final project to test my ability as a data analysis after undergoing serval training.

## KEY INSIGHT

- According to the dataset, there is very significant differences in the consumers preferences. it was discovered that most of the consumers in the data set are from San Luis Potosí in Mexico, making it a primary contributor to the ratings. This highlights the region as a key market in the analysis compared to other state.

- Most consumers preferred Mexican cuisines on a medium budget, and the analysis shows that consumers aged 18-25 provided the majority of ratings and also gave higher scores compared to the other age groups, this indicates a potential age bias in the overall ratings as the preferences of this demographic strongly influenced the result.

- Two of the top 10 highest rated restaurants does not have its cuisine listed in the dimension table. This suggests missing data which limit the ability to compare its performance against cuisine. Although Mexican cuisine was the most preferred by consumers, this preference did not directly translate into the highest ratings. This suggest that while the consumer preferences influence dinning choices, other factors such as service quality, food quality and overall experience had a greater impact on the rating.

## CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION
The analysis reveals that Mexican cuisine is the most preferred among consumers. Additionally, San Luis Potosí hosts the highest number of consumers in the dataset, yet the state has relatively fewer restaurants compared to the level of demand. This gap presents a strategic investment opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors to establish or expand Mexican restaurants in san Luis Potosí, where consumer interest is high but supply is limited.
