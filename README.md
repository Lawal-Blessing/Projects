Based on the results in the dashboard several keys areas of concern and strength were identified, as an employer the following steps can be taken to improve employee satisfaction and overall workplace experiences.


 -	Enhance recognition and praises:
The survey indicates that some employees feel underappreciation for their contributions. Departments like the sheriff’s departments have a higher percentage of disagree in the question “In the last seven days I have received recognition or praise for doing good works”. Employers should implement structured recognition programs (e.g. “employee of the month”, shout outs during meetings, or peer to peer recognition Consistently acknowledging good performance can strengthen motivation and create a positive work culture.

This could be an area for improvement in building a more connected workplace culture. Employer should create cross- departmental interactions, encourage team bonding activities and as well promote inclusivity to ensure no employee feels isolated.
